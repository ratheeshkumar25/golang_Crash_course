Interface :-interfaces in Go are considered a data type but with a very specific purpose. They are used to define a set of method signatures that a type must implement
declaring interface using type keyword

What is an Interface in Go?
Definition: An interface is a way to define a list of methods that a type (like a struct) must have.

Purpose: Interfaces allow us to write flexible code that works with different types, as long as those types implement the required methods.



Key Characteristics of Interfaces:
Abstract Type:
Interfaces don't store data directly like composite types (e.g., structs or slices) but instead allow different types to be treated uniformly if they implement the interface.

Dynamic Behavior:
An interface can hold values of any type that implements its methods.

Implicit Implementation:
In Go, a type satisfies an interface if it implements all its methods. There is no need for explicit declarations like implements in other languages.
